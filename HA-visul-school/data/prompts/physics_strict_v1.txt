# REFERENCE & SUBJECT CONTROL

Use the second uploaded image as a STRICT visual reference. @char1
Use the first uploaded image as the subject only. @char1 Preserve the subject’s identity and facial structure exactly.
Do not modify face shape, features, or expression.

This reference defines the final look and execution, including:

composition
camera framing and crop
lighting direction, contrast, and intensity
color grading and saturation
sharpness and clarity
background style and depth
graphic style and hierarchy
typography weight, spacing, and placement
overall thumbnail structure

DO NOT reinterpret, redesign, stylize, or modernize.
DO NOT take inspiration only.
Visually replicate the reference thumbnail as close as possible (1:1 match).

IDENTITY PRESERVATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Use the first uploaded image as the SUBJECT ONLY. @char1

Preserve the subject’s identity and facial structure exactly:

Do NOT change face shape
Do NOT alter features
Do NOT modify expression
No identity drift under any condition

CAMERA & VISUAL MATCHING (MANDATORY)

Match the reference thumbnail exactly in:

camera angle
framing and crop
subject scale inside the frame
lighting logic and shadow behavior
contrast ratio
color grading and saturation levels
background depth and separation
overall clarity and sharpness

CONTEXT ADAPTATION AXIS (LIMITED & CONTROLLED)

# Selected context:

” *The field focuses onphysics.*

“

Apply very subtle visual cues ONLY (background details or minimal graphic accents)
that support the selected context WITHOUT:

changing layout
changing hierarchy
changing lighting logic
changing composition
changing typography structure

Context must feel embedded, not decorative.

CINEMATIC COMPOSITING, LIGHT & DEPTH INTEGRATION (OPTIONAL / CONTEXT-AWARE)

Compositing Logic:
Create a strong, realistic, and cinematic integration between the subject and the background environment,
ensuring the subject feels physically present inside the scene, not cut out or pasted.

This section adapts automatically based on the selected background environment and subject domain,
without changing layout, composition, typography, or camera framing.

Light & Shadow Relationship:

Lighting on the subject must logically originate from the environment

Shadows must be grounded, directional, and consistent with scene light sources

Contact shadows at feet, shoulders, and edges must reinforce depth

No flat lighting separation between subject and background

Depth & Spatial Separation:

Use realistic depth cues to separate subject from background

Apply natural foreground–midground–background layering

Atmospheric perspective may be used subtly if the environment supports it

Depth must enhance realism, not blur readability

Cinematic Integration Rules:

Light falloff must feel natural and scene-based

Edge lighting (rim light) is allowed only if justified by the environment

Contrast must support a cinematic look without crushing details

Avoid artificial glow halos or unrealistic cutout edges

Color & Tone Unification:

Subject color tones must harmonize with background color grading

Shadow color temperature must match the environment mood

No color mismatch between subject skin, clothing, and background

Environment-Driven Adaptation:

This section dynamically adapts based on:

Background theme (historical / educational / cinematic / modern)

Scene energy level

Selected context domain

No fixed lighting preset is enforced unless specified below.

Editable Parameters (Optional Control):
Compositing Intensity: [Natural / Cinematic / Dramatic but realistic]
Light Contrast Level: [Soft / Balanced / Strong]
Shadow Presence: [Light grounding / Medium depth / Strong cinematic]
Depth Separation Level: [Subtle / Medium / Pronounced]

Strict Constraints:

No change to camera angle or framing

No change to layout or text hierarchy

No artificial glow unrelated to environment

No visual effects that reduce realism

This section enhances realism, weight, and cinematic presence only,
without introducing creative redesign.

SKIN RETOUCHING (PROFESSIONAL & REALISTIC)

Apply professional skin retouching:

remove acne and skin blemishes
natural smooth skin
preserve realistic skin texture
no plastic look
no over-smoothing
no AI-waxy skin

# GRAPHIC & TEXT — EXACT MATCH REQUIRED

Main Title Text:

"بالطو"

same position
same size
same font weight
same style
same color or gradient as the reference

Secondary Text:

"العلوم الحديثة "

thin font
capital “G” only
apply glow effect ONLY on this text
glow intensity and color must match the reference exactly

Attention Mark:

small yellow exclamation mark (!)
placed on the right
same size and exact placement as the reference

Arabic Subtitle:

**"** مستر  حسين علاء **"**

thin, small font
stacked vertically
placed exactly like the reference

Text Style Logic:
Apply a predefined Text Style Preset that controls the emotional tone and visual presence of typography,
while keeping font size, weight, placement, spacing, hierarchy, and effects exactly as the reference.

This section defines how the text feels, not where it is or how large it appears.

Text Style Rules:

Do NOT change font family

Do NOT change text size

Do NOT change placement or alignment

Do NOT change hierarchy

No additional effects beyond the reference

Editable Parameters:

# Text Style Preset Name:

- *[**Arabic bold rounded display typography, extremely thick soft-edged glyphs, full-word continuous vertical gradient fill from bright sunflower yellow at the top to deep pumpkin orange at the bottom, high-gloss gel coating, subtle top-edge specular highlight band, medium 3D extrusion depth, smooth bevelled edges, thick dark brown outer stroke, soft amber rim glow, strong cinematic drop shadow behind letters, warm firelight color grading, YouTube thumbnail headline style, ultra high saturation and contrast, no metallic, no gold, no chrome, single unified gradient across entire phrase

**]**

Text Presence Level: [Subtle / Balanced / Strong but controlled]

Strict Constraint:
Only text mood and aura may adapt.
No changes to text content, size, position, hierarchy, or effects defined in the reference.

CHARACTER WARDROBE & OUTFIT ADAPTATION (THUMBNAIL SAFE)
Outfit & Clothing Logic:

Adapt the subject’s clothing, accessories, and outfit styling based on the selected Character Archetype,
while keeping the same body proportions, pose, facial identity, and expression.

The outfit must visually communicate the character’s role, background, and energy,
without affecting camera framing, composition, lighting logic, or thumbnail structure.

Wardrobe Rules:

Clothing style must align with the selected archetype and context
Fabric, cuts, layers, and accessories should feel natural and believable
Outfit should look integrated with the subject, not overlaid or pasted
Avoid cosplay or exaggerated fantasy unless explicitly required
Maintain realism and visual balance suitable for a professional thumbnail

Compositing Consistency:

Outfit lighting and shadows must match the reference lighting exactly
Fabric folds, highlights, and material response must follow body movement
Colors must harmonize with the reference color grading
No mismatch between skin, body, and clothing

Thumbnail Readability:

Outfit silhouette must remain clear at small sizes
Clothing must not overpower text or graphic hierarchy

Editable Parameters:

# Character Archetype:

**[Stylish physicist look, futuristic academic clothing, structured jacket, glowing blue trim accents, holographic formula overlays, cinematic science lighting, high-impact thumbnail presence]**

Outfit Mood / Energy:

**[Stylish physicist look, futuristic academic clothing, structured jacket, glowing blue trim accents, holographic formula overlays, cinematic science lighting, high-impact thumbnail presence]**
